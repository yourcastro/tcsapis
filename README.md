Subject: Urgent: Performance Issues and Missed Deadlines - Vijay's Task Delivery on LGD Scorecard Project

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally bring to your attention an ongoing concern regarding Vijay's performance on our current project. Despite being assigned key responsibilities, Vijay has not contributed even 1% toward the completion of his assigned tasks so far. His lack of integrity and apparent lack of intent to complete his work is concerning.

Today, Vijay was expected to present the LGD Scorecard demo to me. However, he has been unavailable for the entire day without prior notice, further delaying progress. This is not the first time his performance has caused delays, as I had previously reported similar concerns to both Sunitha and Tania.

Here are the tasks currently assigned to him:

[List the tasks or provide a brief description of each]
If Vijay does not complete these items on time, we risk further delays, which could extend by approximately four more weeks. This would severely impact our project timeline and our reputation with the client.

I kindly request that you take the necessary steps to address this issue as soon as possible, to ensure we maintain the trust and expectations we have built with the client.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Einstine Castro Stephen
[Your Position]
