When we tried running the solution with Windows authentication enabled, we encountered the following error: “HTTP Error 500.30 - ASP.NET Core app failed to start.” However, when running the test solution without any authentication enabled, it worked fine. We need more time to investigate this issue.

Additionally, we noticed that the site configured under the URL “https://dev-intranet-std.ca.sunlife/CreditRiskPortalApi/swagger/index.html” is consistently causing a “redirected too many times” error.
