While integrating the "PD Scorecard Type" API, I noticed that there are no parameters set up to Insert/Update the data in the database. After analyzing the existing logic with @Yallaling Kumbhar, we discovered that a significant portion of the logic was missing. As a result, we need to create a new API to handle the Insert/Update functionality for the "PD Scorecard Type" data.
