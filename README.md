We have created a new site in IIS (CreditRiskPortalApi - http://159.208.208.142:5000/) and deployed our services, itâ€™s working fine. However, we are unable to use the default website 'https://dev-intranet-std.ca.sunlife/CreditRiskPortalApi/swagger/index.html' due to a 'redirected too many times' error.
