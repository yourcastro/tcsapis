Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some concerns regarding Vijay's performance on the current project.

So far, Vijay has not contributed even 1% to the project, despite having several important tasks assigned to him. It appears that he lacks both the integrity and intent to complete these tasks on time, which is negatively impacting the team's progress.

Below are the tasks currently assigned to Vijay:

[Task 1]
[Task 2]
[Task 3]
If these items are not completed by [specific deadline], we estimate that it will take an additional 4 weeks to finish his portion of the work. This delay could severely affect our ability to meet the clientâ€™s expectations and maintain our reputation.

I kindly request that you take the necessary actions to address this situation and ensure the project remains on track.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Einstine Castro Stephen
